# Bikesharing Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to examine New York City's bike-sharing data (CitiBike) to build a visual business proposal that will determine the business prospects of creating a similar model in Des Moines, Iowa.  Tablaeu, Jupyter Notebook, and Pandas DataFrame were utilized to create visualizations, format data, and convert datatypes.

## Software & Resources
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas DataFrame

## Formating and Converting CitiBike Data Set
In order to create various visualizations needed for this analysis, it was necessary to reformat the data and convert the datatype of the column "tripduration" from integer to string.  Jupyter notebook was utilized for this undertaking, and the process can be found [here](https://github.com/retroxsky06/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb).

The bike-sharing analysis begins with a [general overview](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vanessa.aczon/viz/BikesharingAnalysis_16326408649250/CitiBikeAnalysis?publish=yes) which highlights the number of rides, gender breakdown, user type and the top starting locations for rides in the month of August.  The dashboard is intended to provide a brief overview of the data.

**Bike utilization** circle plot is then shown, in which the circle size relates to how often the bike is utilized. **Checkout Times** line graph is showcased, followed by **Checkout Times by Gender** which highlights the significant difference between Male and Female ridership.
