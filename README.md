# Bikesharing Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to examine New York City's bike-sharing data (CitiBike) to build a visual business proposal that will determine the business prospects of creating a similar model in Des Moines, Iowa.  Tablaeu, Jupyter Notebook, and Pandas DataFrame were utilized to create visualizations, format data, and convert datatypes.

## Software & Resources
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas DataFrame

## Formating and Converting CitiBike Data Set
In order to create various visualizations needed for this analysis, it was necessary to reformat the data and convert the datatype of the column "tripduration" from integer to string.  Jupyter notebook was utilized for this undertaking, and the process can be found [here](https://github.com/retroxsky06/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb).

The bike-sharing analysis begins with a [general overview](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vanessa.aczon/viz/BikesharingAnalysis_16326408649250/CitiBikeAnalysis?publish=yes) which highlights the number of rides, gender breakdown, user type and the top starting locations for rides in the month of August 2018.  The dashboard is intended to provide a brief overview of the data.

## Summary
This analysis provided an opportunity to gain insight on a business prospect in Des Moines, Iowa by reviewing NYC bike-sharing data.  It was found that there were over 2 million riders in the month of August 2018, and that the majority of NYC CitiBike riders identified as Male. The data also revealed that the majority of rides began in urban and heavily populated areas. From this finding, we may deduce that bike riding may be a more accessible and attractive mode of transportation due to NYC's traffic congested streets. 

Further research is needed to determine the viability of a Des Moines ride-sharing business.
