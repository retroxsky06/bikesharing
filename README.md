# Bikesharing Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to examine New York City's bike-sharing data (CitiBike) to build a visual business proposal that will determine the business prospects of creating a similar model in Des Moines, Iowa.  Tablaeu, Jupyter Notebook, and Pandas DataFrame were utilized to create visualizations, format data, and convert datatypes.

## Software & Resources
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas DataFrame

## Formating and Converting CitiBike Data Set
In order to create various visualizations needed for this analysis, it was necessary to reformat the data and convert the datatype of the column "tripduration" from integer to string.  Jupyter notebook was utilized for this undertaking, and the process can be found [here](https://github.com/retroxsky06/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb).

This section outlines the business proposal including descriptions and  visualizations of the data. 

The bike-sharing analysis begins with a general overview, which highlights the number of rides, gender breakdown, user type and the top starting locations for rides in the month of August 2018.  The dashboard is intended to provide a brief overview of the data.
#### General Data Overview

**Bike utilization** circle plot is then shown, in which the circle size relates to how often the bike is utilized. 
#### Bike Utilization

**Checkout Times for Users** line graph is showcased, followed by **Checkout Times by Gender** which highlights the significant difference between Male and Female ridership.

The total **Trips by Weekday per Hour** is visualized as a heatmap. It is revealed that the majority of bike trips from Monday to Friday occur from 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm, indicating that the rentals are used around typical work and school commute times.  Whereas we notice that peak hours of bike rentals occur throughout the day over the weekend, 8am-8pm.

When filtering the same heatmap by Gender, it highlights that although peak hours are similiar to the above findings, Male ridership is still higher.

The graph below compares the number of trips by user type (Customer vs Subscriber), Gender, and Weekday.  In the Subscriber group, males have the highest number of bike usage on the following days: Thursday, Friday, Tuesday and Monday.  Comparably, females in the subscriber group have similar trends, but a lower amount of bike usage.  
#### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

## Summary
This analysis provided an opportunity to gain insight on a business prospect in Des Moines, Iowa by reviewing NYC bike-sharing data.  It was found that there were over 2 million riders in the month of August 2018, and that the majority of NYC CitiBike riders identified as Male. The data also revealed that the majority of rides began in urban and heavily populated areas. From this finding, we may deduce that bike riding may be a more accessible and attractive mode of transportation due to NYC's traffic congested streets. 

Although CitiBike may be popular in NYC due to high traffic and various factors, Des Moines, Iowa is a different landscape, and it is not certain that a similiar business model will be successful. Further research on the Des Moines area is needed to determine the viability of a Des Moines bike-sharing business.
